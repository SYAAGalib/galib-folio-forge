This reduces initial load time significantly.</p><h2>2. Memoization with useMemo and useCallback</h2><p>Prevent unnecessary re-renders by memoizing expensive computations and callback functions.</p><h2>3. Virtual Lists for Large Data</h2><p>Use libraries like react-window or react-virtualized for rendering large lists efficiently.</p><h2>4. Image Optimization</h2><p>Implement lazy loading, use WebP format, and serve responsive images to reduce bandwidth.</p><h2>5. Lighthouse Audits</h2><p>Regularly audit your app with Lighthouse to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.</p>",
